# General Coding Challenges

This repo contains General Coding Challenges which are posted occasionally. It's recommended that members of the ESA community try their hands on. The challenges range from beginner to advanced but are not tagged with the level of diffculty. These challenges are meant to help learners improve their approach to problems. For some challenges, some programming languages will be recommended (But you're not limited to those languages).

## How To Join The Challenge

To be able to join and participate, you will need to be added to the ESA-Programming-Community Organization (Contact [admin](mailto:papiliocurtis@gmail.com) for more details).

This is how you solve a challenge
- Clone the repository
- Create a branch with your github username (eg. if my github username is _john_doe_ my branch name will be _john_doe_)
- Switch to that branch and make sure all your solutions are written in your branch. (Pushes made to `master` or `main` branch will be rejected)
- Commit and push your branch to GitHub.

Thats it ðŸŽŠðŸŽ‰. You have successfully solved and submitted your solution.
You can also use the [gish](https://github.com/kurtiz/gish) tool to perform the above procedure.
