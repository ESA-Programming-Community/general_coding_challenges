# Guess The Number
This is a fun game that generates a random number within a given range. After obtaining hints, the user must guess the number. 

When a user's guess is incorrect, they are given more hints to help them out at the expense of their score.

## Recommendations
- Employ the concepts of functions
- Use Python language
