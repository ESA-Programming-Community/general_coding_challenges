# Palindrome checker 
Write a program that takes a string as input and outputs whether the string is a palindrome (i.e., a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards, such as "level" or "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!").

## Recommendations
- Employ the concepts of functions
- Use Python language
